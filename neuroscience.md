# NEUROSCIENCE

Before we examine each of our senses in isolation, we first need to briefly review the common demoniator - the basic physiological function of the brain. The goal is to introduce anyone to the foundations of how neuroscientists currently think about brain function. The focus will be on **neurophysiology**, which is mostly interested in the biological and biochechemical action that underlies brain activity. That is, we will review neuronal _communication_, or _interaction_.  

Neuronal **activation** is only half of the story when it comes to understanding the link between sensation, perception and the brain. We will also need to briefly examine neuronal **connectivity**. After all, if we isolate each neuron of interest in a dish, and observe the same patterns of neuronal activation for each of these isolated neurons, we would not expect perception to arise. It is only because neurons form a _causal network_ that the brain does more than host individual, isolated ON/OFF switches.  

If you already have basic training in systems neuroscience, you can probably skip this chapter since we will merely go over the very basics of neuronal function and neuroanatomy. Hlwever, you might want to browse through this page to ensure that we are not covering anything that you might want a quick refresher for. You might also want to check out the end of this chapter, where we briefly discuss the difference between the _computational_ metaphor of brain function and _information processing_ since this distinction is not usually taught, or made explicit, in neuroscience courses.
