# MATHEMATICS

Science rests on mathematics, so we cannot completely avoid the topic. The following is a brief refresher for the (very limited) mathematics that we will use later on this course. We will start by assuming zero knowledge about mathematics, and then built up quickly from there. If you feel, at any step, that we moved to quickly, this may signify that there is need to brush up a bit via self-study. A few, hopefully helpful, sources and references are provided to do just that.  

## FOUNDATIONS

We already discussed that modern mathematics starts with one or more _axioms_ that one has to accept without further questioning. So, what are the axioms that underly _all_ of mathematics (or, since one can always drop or add axioms and thus change mathematics, the largest body of mathematics)?  

The currently most commonly considered axiomatic foundation of mathematics is **set theory**, specifically the _Zermelo–Fraenkel_ set theory with an additional axiom (the _Axiom of Choice_), abbreviated as **ZFC**.  

There is, fo course, a lot to say about ZFC. The Axiom of Choice, for example, is highly contentious. There is also an alternative proposal for a foundation of mathematics called **category theory**. We will consider the difference between these two starting points of mathematics in a bit since it might be relevant for how we approach mathematics in the context of perception. But for now, let us stick to set theory since - as you will see - it can help us to somewhat intuitovely derive the basic mathematics we require.
