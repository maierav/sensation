# PSYCHOPHYSICS

## Motivation

Before we discuss each of our senses in detail, we first need to take a brief historical detour. The reason for that is an interesting one.  

Much of what we will discuss in the _conext_ of the science of perception will be anything but. For example, we will discuss the physics of light, sound, and mechanical force as well as the chemistry of odorants and gustation. These are all _stimuli_ of our environment that we can sense. However, by themselves they do not lead to perception: According to physics, light inside a room inside a vacated home exists no matter whether there is someone perceiving it or not.  

We then will discuss how our bodies sense these stimuli, such as how photoreceptors react to light. But that, too, seems to have little to do with perception. After all, we can have visual experiences at night in a dark room with eyes closed when we dream. And on the flip side, we seem to not perceive anything even with our eyes open when we are unconscious because we fainted or undergo general anesthesia.  

You might suspect that perception is more closely linked with what your brain does after it receives information from your sense receptors, and that is correct. But, as well see, even this line of inquiry does not get very far - all we will be able to find are brain mechanisms that _correlate_ with perception, such as neurons or areas that increase or decrease in activity whenever we have a certain perceptual experience.  

For this reason we will also review what is known about the _psychology_ of perception, with the ultimate goal to find a _link_ between how perception presents itself to us and the brain mechanisms that support it. But this is where a problem arises.  

How can be scientific about perception? How can we _measure_ it? Put numbers on it?  

At first sight it seems that perception is "too subjective" for "objective" measurement. And in fact, this was the prevailing view of scholars for long periods of history. Some of that skepticism persists. You can still buy stickers online that proclaim "You cannot measure love.", suggesting that feelings (which we defined to be perceptual experiences about our own mental state) are _fundamentally_ unmeasurable. That seems inuitive, but as we will see, it is incorrect.  

## Can you measure love?

Imagine your best friend tells you that they have recently fallen in love. Asking them: "That is wonderful. How much?" will likely just evoke a confused smile.  

But is it really an unanswerable question? After all, it may make sense that they have fallen in love before and that the experience is not the same this time.  

It is not unheard of that people who find "the love of their life" experience that their love for this person is _greater_ than what they have felt before.  

In the same vein, some parents experience that their love for their children leads them to a previously unexperienced form of love: Many parents would gladly lay down their lives for ther children and have not felt that before. This is not to take away from the love they feel for other people, of course. It just seems that they experience _even more_ love for their children.  

And what is measurement other than assessing "more", "less", or "the same"? Numbers seem to make this process just a bit more precise.  

Still, you might feel hesitant to judge what someone perceives by them assigning numbers to it. Not only is perception "subjective", but assigning a value seems "subjective" as well.  

Perhaps surprisingly, we have learned that neither seems to be a fundamental problem. In fact, we make life-or-death decisions based on such self-assigned numbers to perceptual experiences. But before we get to that, we first need to follow the historical arc that led to such a drastic outcome.
