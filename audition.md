Our second most studied sense is hearing.  We know a lot less abou this sense than we do about seeing, but we know a lot more about hearing than we do about all the other senses that we have not yey talked about.  

You will also notice that there are several _principles_ that we have learned when examining vision that will also apply to hearing. In fact, this will be a reoccuring theme and happen for the other senes as well.  

We will proceed just like we did for the sense of seeing, and first talk about what exactly the physical stimuli are that evoke the perception of hearing. Then, we will examine the relevant sense organs. And just like in the case of vision (and as will be the case for the other senes we discuss), there will be a lot more to discuss about these peripheral mechanisms of _sensation_ than what we can subsequently discuss about the neuronal mechanisms of the brain that we believe to support the auditory _perception_. And as we have done for visual perception, we will review the _psychophysics_ and _psychology_ of hearing as well. This will also touch on _speech_ and _music_
