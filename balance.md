# BALANCE

You might have gone "huh?" when you saw this chapter.  

Many people have been taught that there are 5 senses, so what is this 6th sense?  

We already discussed that is questionable to count "touch" as a singular sense since it also covers temperature, pain, and other sensations. We also discussed how our senses of smell and taste collectively give rise to a type of perception that neither of these senses alone seems to cover.  

But even if one sticks to classifying our senses in the classical way (as we did in our chapter outline), there is indeed a 6th sense, and the best we can describe it in simple terms is that it is our sense of balance and orientation in space.
