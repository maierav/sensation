# SENSATION AND PERCEPTION - A PRIMER #

This web site is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the science of sensation and perception, with references provided for deeper self-study. 

## Definitions

_Sensation_ is the process our bodies undergo when acquiring information from our environment, such as when a touch sensor in our skin gets depressed. We are not aware of these processes, and many of them occur even when we are in dreamless sleep, coma, or general anesthesia. Sensation is an unconscious process.

:::{note}
Our _senses_ detect and quantify changes in our *physical* environment. 
:::

_Perception_ is what we *experience* following the process of sensation. That is perception is conscious (arguably the biggest part, or even all of our conscious experience). Note that perception also happens in isolation, fully discoupled from the real world, such as when we hallucinate or dream.

_Science_ is the practice of applying logical reasoning and observations to answering questions about the world. 

DO YOU AGREE WITH THESE DEFINITIONS? HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE THESE TERMS?

## Naive Realism

*Naive Realism* is the view that the world is your perception. That is, the world is exactly how you experience it. You feel, see, hear, smell, and taste things exactly as they are. We call this idea "naive" since it seems to reflect the way that children think about the world before they learn why this idea does not seem to work.

IS NAIVE REALISM CORRECT OR WRONG? WHY?

In fact, the starting point of the science of perception is the realization that what we feel, see, hear, smell, or taste is not to be confused with what the world is _actually_ like.

This realization can esily be demonstrated with visual illusions, where we understand that what we _see_ is "wrong" in that our perception deviates from reality of the physical stimulus.

One interesting fact about visual illusions is that they often persist even when exactly understand in what aspects they differ from the actual physical stimulus. In other words, even knowing *that* and *how* our perception differs from the real world does not help - our perception does not correct and adjust to what we know to be really the case.

The consequence of this insight is that there seem to be two different things, or domains that are not identical (since one can deviate from the other): 

1) The physical world consisting of the universe, our local environment, and our own bodies.

2) Our conscious subjective perception of our environment and bodies.

There are many corrolaries from that view, many of which raise deep questions that humanity has not found satisfying answers for yet. 

## Beyond Naive Realism

### HOW INDIVIDUAL IS PERCEPTION? 
If our perception is different from the world (i.e., what and how we perceive things is not the same as the physical reality of these things), the question arises if each of us perceives the world _differently_. 

ASK YOURSELF - DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT I CALL "RED" MIGHT IN FACT BE WHAT YOU CALL "GREEN"? WOULD WE EVER ABLE TO FIND OUT? HOW?

As we will see, the answer is a bit mixed. There are, of course, individual differences in, say, how we perceive color since some of us are what we colloquially call "color blind" (we will see why this is a misleading term). However, as we go along, we will see that we generally seem to perceive very much alike. 

IS THAT SURPISING? WHY OR WHY NOT?

### WHAT AND HOW CAN WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WORLD IF OUR PERCEPTION CAN BE WRONG?
Another puzzle that arises from our realization that we can fall pray to perceptual illusions is that this seems to put into question how we can _know_ that to be the case. DO we only know the world only from our perception? How else can we learn about the world? Can we know for certain that there really _is_ a world "outside" our perception?

This line of questioning may seem ludicruous at first. We all seem to agree that there is a "real world out there". How could this be questioned? And, at first, there does not seem to be a problem to know what that world _is like_. Is that not what physics and other sciences do - tell us what the world "really is", even if different and independent of our own perception?

But deeper reflection makes clear that this is not, in fact, so easy. Let us unpack that.

#### PLATO'S CAVE
You might have heard about Plato's allegory of the cave. In this ancient ficticious story, a group of people is held hostage inside a cave. They grew up there and never were able to step outside. In fact, these people do not even know that there is an outside. Since they grew up inside that cave, they have no reason to believe that the world is much more than that one place - the only place - that they know Plato wants us to imagine what things would be like for these people. 

Plato goes on that we should imagine that these people are chained to a wall so that they cannot turn around and see what is behind them. Again, he asks us to just imagine the scenario and put ourselves into the shoes of these people to make an interesting point.

He then goes on to describe that there is gap in the walls of that cave - a window of sorts. Light falls through that gap and the people that grew up inside that cave can only see that light on a wall opposite to that opening.

Here comes the kicker: Plato now describes that the people inside the cave can sometimes see shadows on that wall that is illuminated by the gap behind them. Now, imagine that you are one of the people that grew up in that position. For you, the shadows cannot be understood as shadows. That is, because you have no concept of shadows. You just see sillhouettes opposite to you. They are part of your world. They are "real" to you as much as anything else inside the cave.

Plato's story goes on, but the key insight can already be made here. Plato makes clear that the people inside the cave could be fooled, for example, by people on the outside purposefully walking cut-outs made of paper or would along the gap behind the people inside the cave and create a "shadow theater" for the people inside, like we sometimes do for young kids. There is no way to know for the people inside the cave that the shadows they see are just artificially created by people outside - since they do not know that what a shadow is, that there is an outside, let alone people that are outside.

What does any of that have to do with perception? Well, one corollary of us establishing that
1) There is a real world "outside" our perception
2) Our perception seems to be more like a reflection, or "shadow" of that world
is that we are in a similar position as these people inside the cave: We only know the "shadows", a reflection, of the world and not the world itself. Our skulls, our brains, seem to be similar to that cave in that our perception arises from "inside" these structures. 

Finding out what the real world, that is responsible for the "shadows" of our perception, is actually like then seems to become challenging: We have to _reason_ about what this world might be like since we cannot go by our perception alone.

This may still sound a bit confusing at this point. After all, we have not talked about what role our brains play in all of that (and since brains are obviously also part of that world that we perceive). We all share to some degree the notion that our brains are linked to our feelings, our ability to see, hear, smell, or taste. But what we will learn soon is _how closely_ linked the actions of our brain are to what we perceive. For now, it is only important to follow the logic of Plato's allegory: _If_ our direct acquintance with the world is our perception, and that perception can be unreliable (as in the sxistence of illusions), the problem arises that we have to find additional ways other than our perception to learn about the world.

#### PERCEPTION vs. WORLD
Many thinkers that followed Plato have thought deeply about this issue. However, they failed to all settle on the same solution. Instead, these scholars have endowed us with a variety of ways to think about that problem, each arguing for their favorite idea. Let us briefly (and superficially) examine the various proposed answers. The academic field that studies these ideas is called _PHILOSOPHY OF MIND_, and there are thousands of academic works on this subject. Here we will attempt at the most minimal possible overview of major "schoolf of thought" within this field:

##### MONISM
One possible solution is that there really is only one thing. That is, the assumption that we had that there is a world and our perception of the world is wrong. This leaves only two options: All is the world (i.e., there is no perception), or all is perception (there is no world).

The actual ideas are a bit more complex, but they do not deviate far from the sentence above. The technical terms we use for these ideas are:

*MATERIALISM*: There is only the world. There is no perception. If you think that you perceive something, what really happens is that you _behave_ or _function_ according to what you call a perception (which is why this view is sometimes also called **BEHAVIORISM** or **FUNCTIONALISM**). You thinking that you perceive things beyond behaving and functioning according to physics, is _illusory_. You _believe_ you perceive, say the color "red", but that is a false belief. You just act as if you do. Some proponents of this view prefer the term "physicalism" to demonstrate that they agree with modern physics in that "matter" is not a substance (modern physics describes matter as "an interaction" between the Higgs field and other quantum fields, but you do not need to worry that you need to know about all of this).

*IDEALISM*: There is no physical world. All is perception (again, technically, proponents of this view would use broader terms like "mind", or "consciousness" - but it is debatable how much these concepts do or do not overlap). There are two options on this view:

    **SOLIPSISM**: Your perception is all that exists. Nothing else is real. You are all alone. Everything is just an illusion, except your perception. This view is difficult to argue with rationally. At the same time, view people are convinced by this view, let alone prefer this view since it resembles a horrifying reality.

    **PANPSYCHISM**: Everything is perception. This view grants that there is "a world out there", but it assumes that that which exists outside our own perception is even more perception - a grand ocean of perception, if you will. Proponents of this view suggest that something keeps our own perception separate from the rest of perception out there.

##### DUALISM
Another possible solution is that there really are two different things: a world and our perception. But there are some disagreements on what exactly makes them different.

**SUBSTANCE DUALISM**: This view, often credited to René Descartes, even though it can be found in many (older) cultures around the world is that your perception is real, yet "immaterial". And that the world is "material", or physical. Proponents of this view try to explain why and how these two domains are linked, such as how (material) brain damage or intoxication can alter (immaterial) perception. On this view, (immaterial) perception might also be able to affect the (material) world.

**ASPECT DUALISM**: This idea takes a bit of a middle ground. It does assume that there "really" only is one thing, and thus subscribes to monism. However, it suggests that one and the same thing can have different aspects, or properties when viewed from different percectives - somewhat like a coin can look very different if one only looks at heads or tails. Aspect dualism assumes that there is a real world that may well be physical, but that our perception is what some physical systems, like our brains, _are like_ from the "inside". This view explains why brain damage can affect perception since they are just "two sides of the same coin". 

There are many more ideas on that problem, some of which cannot neatly placed within the taxonomy above. However, these cateogories provide a somewhat of a sufficient survey of the field since most ideas come close to, or combine, these distinct schools of thought. To give you an example, some scholars will state that they are "_REDUCTIONIST PHYSICALIST_", for example. A popular version of this view is that "there is only the physical universe" and that perception "emerges" from some physical system in a way that can be explained by physical laws. Note, how this notion comes close to our option of _ASPECT DUALISM_.

WHICH OF THESE IDEAS BEST DESCRIBE YOUR OWN VIEW? WHY DO YOU DISMISS THE OTHER VIEWS?

For the purpose of this course, we will adopt a somewhat neutral dualistic stance. That is, we will base our knowledge about the world on the atural sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology. At the same time, we will treat perception as a real phenomenon that goes beyond its behavioral or functional corrolaries. At the end of the semester, we will re-examine this view, and discuss how what we learned can also be applied to other views. As we will see, the scientific knowledge that we will gain will end up as largely compatible with _most_, if not all, of these views. At the same time, you will have learned new facts and logical insights that pose challenges to each of these views, thus making it even more interesting to ponder about their validity.
