Our exploration of the science of perception will cover all of our senses. However, we will spend most effort to study vision. There are several reasons for this choice:  

    1. Most of our sensory brain areas are concerned with vision.
    2. Vision seems to be more "dominant" than other senses.
    3. Even dreams seem to be mostly visual.
    4. Vision is relatively easy to study experimentally.
    5. Accordingly, vision is the most studied sense.  

We will always follow the same outline for the senses that we will discuss:

First, we will discuss about the stimuli that these senses detect. This implies that we will start with _physics_ and _chemistry_. Some of that physics will also require us to review certain _mathematical_ principles and laws.

Next, we will explore the _psychology_ of each sense. That is, we will briefly go over what is known from behavioral measurements about how we sense and perceive each sense in isolation or in combination with the other senses.

Then, we will review the _anatomy_ of our sense organs, including their _neuroanatomy_. This includes a brief review of the basics of _systems neuroscience_ as well.

Lastly, we will surbey what is known about the brain mechanisms that go along with the sensation and perception of each sense.  

You might be most interested in the last of these steps only. That would be understandable. After all, we started with some puzzling _philosophical_ questions surrounding perception, and you might hope that we will (only) find an answer to these questions once we learn what the brain does when we perceive something.  

However, as you will see, we will not find satissfying answers to these philosophical question at that point. In fact, the mystery might deepen. You will also find that starting from physics becomes important and informative at that point.  

This is not meant to let you down. In fact, there are suggestions for satisfying answers, and we will discuss them at the end. These proposals will only be comprehensible, though, _after_ we completed the full survey of the physics, anatomy, psychology, and neuroscience of the senses.

So, let us begin.

## OPTICS

% Vision
:::{div}

:label: fig:vision
:width: 85%

Visual sensation starts with light rays entering our eyes, bending at the lens and ending up as a two-dimensional projection (image) at the back of our eye balls - the retina. As a consequence, visual sensation is subjected to the laws of optics - the geometry of light propagation.[^2]

Vision seemingly starts with light (if we put dreams and hallucinations aside for a moment). But what is that - light?

### Light

The physics of light (optics) is a rabbit hole that is easy to fall down in. One reason for that is that it can quickly lead us from high school physics to quantum physics and relativity. Luckily, we do not have to do that for garnering a basic understanding of physics relevant for our visual perception.  

In simple terms, light is **electromagnetic radiation**.  

Light, in fact, is just the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see (due to the biophysics of our photoreceptors).

## BRAIN

% Visual Pathway
:::{div}
:class: hidden dark:block

:::{figure} ./images/visual_pathway_dark.png
:label: fig:vision
:width: 40%

The primary visual pathway, colored coded by _visual field_ (not by eye). Neurons (**retinal ganglion cells**, or RGC) from both eyes first meet at the x-shaped **optic chiasm**. Half of the fibers cross so that the fibers from each eye that correspond to the same visual hemifield are bundled. These fibers then terminate at the dorsal **lateral geniculate nucleus**, or LGN, of the thalamus. Most LGN neurons then project to the back of the cerebral cortex and arrive at the **primary visual cortex**, or V1.[^4]
